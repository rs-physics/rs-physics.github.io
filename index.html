      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
      <p>
        This website contains a repository of resources made to help teach and 
        revise GCSE and A-level physics made by myself. Please note that these were
        designed with the AQA specification in mind, but can probably be used for general
        physics as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        A significant portion of the videos were made during the COVID pandemic, and have been
        uploaded now for general use.  I may add some more videos, simulations and other
        resources over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explore, and learn, hopefully some of these resources will be of use.
